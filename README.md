# House-Prediction-Model

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project aims to predict median house values based on various features like income, location, and property attributes.

The code is designed to be fully reproducible, with a single script handling both model training and inference.

The model uses a Random Forest Regressor and a full preprocessing pipeline for robust predictions.
